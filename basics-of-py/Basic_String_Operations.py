# Basic String Operations
# Strings are bits of text. They can be defined as anything between quotes:

astring = "Hello world"
astring2 = 'Hello world!'
print(astring)
print(astring2)
# As you can see, the first thing you learned was printing a simple sentence. This sentence was stored by Python as a string. However, instead of immediately printing strings out, we will explore the various things you can do to them. You can also use single quotes to assign a string. However, you will face problems if the value to be assigned itself contains single quotes. For example to assign the string in these bracket(single quotes are ' ') you need to use double quotes only like this

astring = "Hello world!"
print("singer quotes are ''")

print(len(astring))
