# There are two types of loops in Python, for and while.

# The "for" loop
# For loops iterate over a given sequence. Here is an example:
primes = [2, 3, 5]
for prime in primes:
    print(prime)

# For loops can iterate over a sequence of numbers using the "range" and "xrange" functions. The difference between range and xrange is that the range function returns a new list with numbers of that specified range, whereas xrange returns an iterator, which is more efficient. (Python 3 uses the range function, which acts like xrange). Note that the range function is zero based.
# Prints out the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
for x in range(3, 6):
    print(x)
    
# Prints out 3, 4, 5
for x in range(3, 6):
    print(x)
    
# Prints out 3,5,7
for x in range(3, 8, 2):
    print(x)

# "while" loops
# While loops repeat as long as a certain boolean condition is met. For example:
# Print out 0,1,2,3,4

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1 #This is the same as count = count + 1


# "break" and "continue" statements
# break is used to exit a for loop or a while loop, whereas continue is used to skip the current block, and return to the "for" or "while" statement. A few examples:
count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        break
    
# Prints out only odd numbers - 1,3,5,7,9
for x in range(10):
    # Check if x is even
    if x % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(x)

# Can we use "else" clause for loops?
# Unlike languages like C,CPP.. we can use else for loops. When the loop condition of "for" or "while" statement fails then code part in "else" is executed. If a break statement is executed inside the for loop then the "else" part is skipped. Note that the "else" part is executed even if there is a continue statement.

# Here are a few examples:
count=0
while(count<5):
    print(count)
    count +=1
else:
    print("count value reached %d" %(count))
    
# Prints out 1,2,3,4
for i in range(1, 10):
    if(i%5==0):
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("This is not printed because for loop is terminated because of break but due to fail in condition")
