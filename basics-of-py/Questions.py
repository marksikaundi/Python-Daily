# About basic operators
# The target of this exercise is to create two lists called x_list and y_list, which contain 10 instances of the variables x and y, respectively. You are also required to create a list called big_list, which contains the variables x and y, 10 times each, by concatenating the two lists you have created.
x = object()
y = object()

# TODO: change this code
x_list = [x] * 10
y_list = [y] * 10
big_list = x_list + y_list

print("x_list contains %d objects" % len(x_list))
print("y_list contains %d objects" % len(y_list))
print("big_list contains %d objects" % len(big_list))

# testing code
if x_list.count(x) == 10 and y_list.count(y) == 10:
    print("Almost there...")
if big_list.count(x) == 10 and big_list.count(y) == 10:
    print("Great!")


# Exercise About string
# You will need to write a format string which prints out the data using the following syntax: Hello John Doe. Your current balance is $53.44.
data = ("Mark", "Sikaundi", 53.44)
format_string = "Hello"

print(format_string % data)


# EXERCISE About Strings Operations
# Try to fix the code to print out the correct information by changing the string.
s = "Hey there! what should this string be?"
# Length should be 20
print("Length of s = %d" % len(s))

# First occurrence of "a" should be at index 8
print("The first occurrence of the letter a = %d" % s.index("a"))

# Number of a's should be 2
print("a occurs %d times" % s.count("a"))

# Slicing the string into bits
print("The first five characters are '%s'" % s[:5]) # Start to 5
print("The next five characters are '%s'" % s[5:10]) # 5 to 10
print("The thirteenth character is '%s'" % s[12]) # Just number 12
print("The characters with odd index are '%s'" %s[1::2]) #(0-based indexing)
print("The last five characters are '%s'" % s[-5:]) # 5th-from-last to end

# Convert everything to uppercase
print("String in uppercase: %s" % s.upper())

# Convert everything to lowercase
print("String in lowercase: %s" % s.lower())

# Check how a string starts
if s.startswith("Str"):
    print("String starts with 'Str'. Good!")

# Check how a string ends
if s.endswith("ome!"):
    print("String ends with 'ome!'. Good!")

# Split the string into three separate strings,
# each containing only a word
print("Split the words of the string: %s" % s.split(" "))
