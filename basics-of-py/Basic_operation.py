# This section explains how to use basic operators in Python.

# Arithmetic Operators
# Just as any other programming languages, the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators can be used with numbers.

number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0
print(number)

# modulo (%)
remainder = 11 % 3
print(remainder)

# Using two multiplication symbols makes a power relationship.
squared = 7 ** 2
cube = 2 ** 3
print(squared)
print(cube)

# Using Operators with Strings
# Python supports concatenating strings using the addition operator:

helloworld = "hello" + "" + "world"
print(helloworld)

# Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence:
programmersmemes = "Mark" * 10
print(programmersmemes)

# Using Operators with Lists
# Lists can be joined with the addition operators:
even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
add_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = add_numbers + even_numbers
print(all_numbers)

# Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:

# Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:
print([1,2,3] * 3)
