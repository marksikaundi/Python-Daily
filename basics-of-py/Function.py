# What are Functions?
# Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.

# How do you write functions in Python?
# As we have seen on previous tutorials, Python makes use of blocks.

# A block is a area of code of written in the format of:

# Where a block line is more Python code (even another block), and the block head is of the following format: block_keyword block_name(argument1,argument2, ...) Block keywords you already know are "if", "for", and "while".

# Functions in python are defined using the block keyword "def", followed with the function's name as the block's name. For example:

def my_function():
    print("Hello from my function!")
